[Imber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imber) is an uninhabited village.
The Ministry of Defence slowly bought up the village. During the Second World War, the whole population was evicted to provide a training area.
The village is open to non-military users for a few days a year. On one occasion, [buses](https://imberbus.org/) are available.
